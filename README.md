NOTE:
This is meant to showcase the skills I learned as part of the course. PLEASE DO NOT USE IF IN THE COURSE AS IT IS VALUABLE TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THE PROBLEMS ON YOUR OWN! First few chapters are basic coding/python tutorial and not included.


Table of contents:

	Chapter Three: Conditional Code
		In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes "choices".
		3.1 Conditional Statements
		3.2 More Conditional Statements


	Chapter Four: Functions
		This is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.
		4.1 - Using Functions
		4.2 - Building Functions


	Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration
		Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.
		5.1 - Loops and Iteration
		5.2 - Definite Loops
		5.3 - Finding the Largest Value
		5.4 - Loop Idioms


	Chapter Six: Strings
		In this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in Chapter 6 of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures. The second week of this class is dedicated to getting Python installed if you want to actually run the applications on your desktop or laptop. If you choose not to install Python, you can just skip to the third week and get a head start.
		6.1 - Strings
		6.2 - Manipulating Strings


	Chapter Seven: Files
		Up to now, we have been working with data that is read from the user or data in constants. But real programs process much larger amounts of data by reading and writing files on the secondary storage on your computer. In this chapter we start to write our first programs that read, scan, and process real data.
		7.1 - Files
		7.2 - Processing Files


	Chapter Eight: Lists
		As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables. Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable. Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable. We call these multi-valued variables "collections" or "data structures".
		8.1 - Lists
		8.2 - Manipulating Lists
		8.3 - Lists and Strings


	Chapter Nine: Dictionaries
		The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures. Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs. Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory "database" in a single Python variable.
		9.1 - Dictionaries
		9.2 - Counting with Dictionaries
		9.3 - Dictionaries and Files


	Chapter Ten: Tuples
		Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure. Tuples are a simple version of lists. We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.
		10 - Tuples

	Chapter Eleven: Regular Expressions
		Regular expressions are a very specialized language that allow us to succinctly search strings and extract data from strings. Regular expressions are a language unto themselves. It is not essential to know how to use regular expressions, but they can be quite useful and powerful.
		11 - R.E.
	
	Chapter Twelve: Networks and Sockets / Programs that Surf the web
		In this section we learn about the protocols that web browsers use to retrieve documents and web applications use to interact with Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and learn to use Python to retrieve data from web sites and APIs over the Internet.
		12.1 Networked Technology
		12.2 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
		12.3 Unicode Characters and Strings
		12.4 Retrieving Web Pages
		12.5 Parsing Web Pages
	
	Chapter Thirteen: Webservices (XML and JSON)
		In this section, we learn how to retrieve and parse XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data as well as Application Program Interfaces / Web Services using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format.
		13.1 Data on the Web
		13.2 eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
		13.3 XML Schema
		13.4 Parsing XML
		13.5 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
		13.6 Service Oriented Approach
		13.7 Using Application Programming Interfaces
		13.8 Securing API Requests
